"Recently, DL system optimization research has been widely studied and "
"published by high-level conferences on machine learning and computation "
"systems (e.g., OSDI, SOSP, SIGMOD, VLDB, MLSys, ASPLOS, ATC, EuroSys, "
"PPoPP, etc.). Our Hetu development team has obtained many academic "
"achievements and technological accumulations. We welcome all of you to "
"join this challenging approach and we prepared two projects for you to "

"With the increasing amounts of data and the growing size of models, "
"distributed DL is becoming more and more important. High-performance "
"distributed training is a crucial challenge for emerging large DL models,"
" such as GPT-3 and PanGu, which consist of trillions of parameters and "
"require thousands of GPUs for distributed training. This project targets:"
" 1) integrating data/model/pipeline parallelism to improve the training "
"efficiency; 2) re-design the distributed system interfaces and "
"architectures to support automatically distributed training over Hetu. "

"In recent years, many ML researchers have focused their attention "
"intensely on certain DL models due to their powerful performance. Making "
"system optimization on these models is significant when scaling them to "
"large-scale and high-dimensional data inputs. This project targets "
"certain DL models (i.e., GNN, Transformer, Knowledge Graph Embedding) and"
" developing individual open-source modules with GPU or distributed "
"acceleration over Hetu."
