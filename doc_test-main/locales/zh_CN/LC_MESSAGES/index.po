"**Hetu** is a high-performance distributed deep learning system, "
"developed by the team of Professor `Bin Cui "
"<http://net.pku.edu.cn/~cuibin/index.html>`_ from Peking University (past"
" work targets distributed ML systems, including `Angel "
"<https://github.com/Tencent/Angel-ML>`_). The system is completely "
"decoupled from the existing DL systems. It takes account of both high "
"availability in industry and innovation in academia, which has a number "
"of advanced characteristics:"
