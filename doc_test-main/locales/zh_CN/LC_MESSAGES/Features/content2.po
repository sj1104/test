"All-reduce is the key communication primitive used in distributed data-"
"parallel training due to the high performance in the homogeneous "
"environment. However, All-reduce is sensitive to stragglers and "
"communication delays as deep learning has been increasingly deployed on "
"the heterogeneous environment like cloud."

"We propose and analyze a novel variant of all-reduce, called partial-"
"reduce, which provides high heterogeneity tolerance and performance by "
"decomposing the synchronous all-reduce primitive into parallel-"
"asynchronous partial-reduce operations."

"We provide theoretical guarantees, proving that partial-reduce converges "
"to a stationary point at the similar sub-linear rate as distributed SGD. "
"To enforce the convergence of the partial-reduce primitive, we further "
"propose a dynamic staleness-aware distributed averaging algorithm and "
"implement a novel group generation mechanism to prevent possible update "
"isolation in heterogeneous environments. The experiments on real "
"production cluster show that it is 1.21×-2× faster than other state-of-"
"the-art baselines."
