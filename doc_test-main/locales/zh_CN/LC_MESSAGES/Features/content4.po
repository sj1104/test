"Embedding models have been recognized as an effective learning paradigm "
"for high-dimensional data. However, one open issue of embedding models "
"lies in its representation (latent factors) often resulting in large "
"parameter space. We observe existing distributed training frameworks face"
" a scalability issue of embedding models since updating and retrieving "
"the shared embedding parameters from servers usually dominate the "
"training cycle."

"We propose a new system framework that signiffcantly improves the "
"scalability of huge embedding model training. We embrace skewed "
"popularity distributions of embeddings as a performance opportunity and "
"leverage it to address the communication bottleneck with an embedding "
"cache. To ensure consistency across the caches, we incorporate a new "
"consistency model into the system design, which provides fine-grained "
"consistency guarantees on a per-embedding basis."

"Evaluations show that it achieves up to 80% embedding communication "
"reductions and up to 20x performance speedup over the state-of-the-art "
